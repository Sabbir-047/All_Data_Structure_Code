            <--- Theory --->
    If we have to told to choose which complexity is best. Then we will consider a number. Then we will implement the number into complexities. Then we will be able to tell which one is best.

    Supposse, We habe N = 1000;

    Constant:           O(1)        -> 1            
    Linear:             O(N)        -> 1000
    Logarithmic:        O(log N)    -> 10
    Square root:    	O(sqrt(N))  -> 32
    Quadratic:          O(N*N)      -> 1000000
    Linearithmic:       O(NlogN)    -> (1000 * 10)

    --------------
    best to worst -> 
    --------------
    constant, 
    logarithmic, 
    square root, 
    linear, 
    linearithmic,
